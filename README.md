# Hi there

This is the first version of my personal ChatGPT CLI tool. It is a TypeScript project that uses the OpenAI API to generate text. The app runs in Node.js and uses the readline module to get user input via the command line.

## Installation
1. Install the dependencies with `pnpm i`
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. Run the app with `pnpm run dev`

## Future plans
- Make it generate files in the working directory (for example, React components with css modules, storybook stories, tests, etc.)
